# Diabetes Disease Prediction Using Machine Learning

• Built a model using ML and the algorithm used is Random Forest Classifier with the help of Kaggle dataset to predict early onset on diabetes disease.

• Python libraries such as Pandas, Matplotlib, Scikit-Learn, NumPy were useful in analyzing and visualizing the data.

• The accuracy of the model is 90%, which was initially 80%.
